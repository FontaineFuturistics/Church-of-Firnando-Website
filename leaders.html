                        immediately attempted to supersede the High Priest's role of supreme leader. Oh, and she is currently

                            He spends much of his time with computers, however he also does fencing because those two are obviously closely intertwined activities.

                        Picture the scene- It's the spring of 2018. Me and a friend, soon to be known as the Betrayer,
                        are leaving the theater after a 7:00 showing of A Quiet Place. These details are engraved thoroughly in my mind,
                        for it was that night that I discovered a higher power in the form of a rubber duck. I am Elsa of the Cole,
                        real name Ellery Cole, and I have set out to do good in the world by worshipping a rubber duck. I am a professional fake gamer,
                        D&D enthusiast, and cult leader by day, but an edgy teenage poet, discord connoisseur, and failed evil mastermind by night.
                        By creating the Church of Firnando, I seek to build an environment that brings the sense of support and community of a religion
                        without the focus on a higher power that is required to feel worth in one. Religion has always been something that bothers me,
                        and I was inspired to attempt to create a better alternative, and perhaps do some good and forge a positive community in the process.
                        I'm not that interesting of a person, but I do hope I can help lead the amazing people in the Church of Firnando, and our communities,
                        to make a real impact and push the world in a better direction.
